# Would You Rather Project
Based on the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. Bootstrapped via Create React App, it allows users create, answer questions, while tracking individual question results and seeing how you compare to your friends via the leaderboard. This app leverages React and Redux as the store.
